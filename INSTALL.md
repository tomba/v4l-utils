# Installation

## Requirements

* meson and a C and C++ compiler
* optionally libjpeg v6 or later
* optionally Qt5 for building qv4l2

## Basic installation

v4l-utils can be built and installed using meson as follows:

```
meson build/
ninja -C build/
sudo ninja -C build/ install
```

## Configuration

You can get a summary of possible configurations running:

```
meson configure build/
```

To change the options values use the `-D` option:

```
meson configure -Doption=newvalue
```

After configuration you need to start the build process with:

```
ninja -C build/
```

More info about meson options:
[https://mesonbuild.com/Build-options.html](https://mesonbuild.com/Build-options.html)

## Installing

If you need to install to a different directory than the install prefix, use
the `DESTDIR` environment variable:

```
DESTDIR=/path/to/staging/area ninja -C build/ install
```

## Static builds

Meson provides a built-in option to set the default library type:

```
Core options     Default Value  Possible Values         Description
------------     -------------  ---------------         -----------
default_library  shared         [shared, static, both]  Default library type
```

As previously described, it can be set as follows during the configuration step:

```
meson configure -Ddefault_library=static
```

Note that this will just build static libraries, but linking to dependencies and
system libraries dynamically.

*Fully static* builds are not supported yet and would require custom
configuration and setting proper flags. By the time of this writing, there's an
ongoing issue in meson to add this feature, see
https://github.com/mesonbuild/meson/issues/7621

## Cross Compiling

Meson supports cross-compilation by specifying a number of binary paths and
settings in a file and passing this file to `meson` or `meson configure` with
the `--cross-file` parameter.

Below are a few example of cross files, but keep in mind that you will likely
have to alter them for your system.

32-bit build on x86 linux:

```
[binaries]
c = '/usr/bin/gcc'
cpp = '/usr/bin/g++'
ar = '/usr/bin/gcc-ar'
strip = '/usr/bin/strip'
pkgconfig = '/usr/bin/pkg-config-32'
llvm-config = '/usr/bin/llvm-config32'

[properties]
c_args = ['-m32']
c_link_args = ['-m32']
cpp_args = ['-m32']
cpp_link_args = ['-m32']

[host_machine]
system = 'linux'
cpu_family = 'x86'
cpu = 'i686'
endian = 'little'
```

64-bit build on ARM linux:

```
[binaries]
c = '/usr/bin/aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc'
cpp = '/usr/bin/aarch64-linux-gnu-g++'
ar = '/usr/bin/aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc-ar'
strip = '/usr/bin/aarch64-linux-gnu-strip'
pkgconfig = '/usr/bin/aarch64-linux-gnu-pkg-config'
exe_wrapper = '/usr/bin/qemu-aarch64-static'

[host_machine]
system = 'linux'
cpu_family = 'aarch64'
cpu = 'aarch64'
endian = 'little'
```

64-bit build on x86 windows:

```
[binaries]
c = '/usr/bin/x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc'
cpp = '/usr/bin/x86_64-w64-mingw32-g++'
ar = '/usr/bin/x86_64-w64-mingw32-ar'
strip = '/usr/bin/x86_64-w64-mingw32-strip'
pkgconfig = '/usr/bin/x86_64-w64-mingw32-pkg-config'
exe_wrapper = 'wine'

[host_machine]
system = 'windows'
cpu_family = 'x86_64'
cpu = 'i686'
endian = 'little'
```
